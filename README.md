# SongPopper
This is a Google Chrome extension, for SongPop. It will display the correct answers. It does not alter the page or the swf. This makes it undetectable, and safe to use.

## How To Install
Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ggajjiolijnoobokjaghfjhibpofamhh and install it like any other extention.

## How To Use
Just click the little node icon, if you are on a songpop page it will open a window that will display the correct answers. If you are on a other tab, it will open a new songpop tab.

## TODO
