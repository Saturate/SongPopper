#SongPopper
This is a Google Chrome extension, for SongPop. It will display the correct answers. It does not alter the page or the swf. This makes it undetectable, and safe to use.

##How To Install
I'll try to add it to the Google Chrome Store. Untill then you need to install it some other way.

####Install with crx file:

- Open "chrome://chrome/extensions/" in a tab.
- Drag the songpopper.crx to this page.

If you don't do this, you will get a popup that says you need to install it from the Chrome Store.

##How To Use
Just click the little node icon, if you are on a songpop page it will open a window that will display the correct answers. If you are on a other tab, it will open a new songpop tab.
